You are a senior full-stack engineer working in this repo (Dev-Assistant). Implement the following improvements cleanly and end-to-end:

GOAL A — Separate the Client vs Assistant payment portals (they feel the same today):
1) Update the bottom nav in client/src/components/layout/bottom-nav.tsx:
   - If user role is CLIENT, the “Money” tab should navigate to /pay (not /spending).
   - If user role is ASSISTANT, the “Money” tab should navigate to /spending (or /get-paid if you think that’s better).
   Keep the Files tab in the nav.
2) Ensure /payment-profile is assistant-only UX:
   - If a CLIENT hits /payment-profile, redirect them to /pay and show a toast like “Payment details are set by your assistant.”
   - In PayNowSheet, if payment methods are not configured, clients should NOT see a “Set up payment methods” button that routes to /payment-profile; instead show a message “Ask your assistant to set up payment methods.”

GOAL B — Fix payment method enum mismatch and make tips work reliably:
3) Standardize payment method constants to match the DB enum:
   Use only: "VENMO" | "ZELLE" | "CASH_APP" | "PAYPAL"
   Replace every usage of "CASHAPP" in:
   - client/src/pages/payment-profile.tsx
   - client/src/pages/get-paid.tsx
   - client/src/pages/pay.tsx
   - client/src/components/pay-now-sheet.tsx
   with "CASH_APP"
   Also update any labels accordingly.
4) Add server-side validation in server/routes.ts in PATCH /api/spending/:id/status:
   - If paymentMethodUsed is provided, it must be one of the allowed values; otherwise return 400.
   This prevents enum write failures.
5) Ensure tipAmount and paymentMethodUsed are persisted correctly when client marks PAYMENT_SENT (already mostly implemented). Confirm pay-now-sheet sends tipAmount and paymentMethodUsed and that the server stores them.

GOAL C — Make assistant household switching fully functional:
6) Fix storage import bug in server/storage.ts:
   - users and type User must be imported from @shared/models/auth (shared/models/auth.ts), not @shared/schema.
7) Implement missing multi-household functions referenced by household routes/middleware:
   - Add to IStorage in server/storage.ts:
     a) getUserHouseholds(userId): returns list of households the user belongs to (id, name, organizationId)
     b) setDefaultHousehold(userId, householdId): sets isDefault=true for that user_profile and false for others
   - Implement these methods in DatabaseStorage using joins between user_profiles and households.
8) Confirm /api/households/mine and /api/households/set-default in server/routes/households.ts work end-to-end with the HouseholdSwitcher component.
   - When a household is selected, store activeHouseholdId in localStorage (already done in client), and ensure requests include x-household-id header (already done in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts).
   - Ensure householdContext middleware returns a clear 409 with households list if multiple and none selected/default.

Deliverables:
- Code changes in the above files.
- Keep TypeScript types clean (no any where avoidable).
- Test manually: assistant with 2+ households can switch; client sees /pay; marking PAYMENT_SENT with CASH_APP works and tipAmount persists.
