You are a senior full-stack engineer working inside this existing Replit project: “hndld” (Node/Express + TypeScript + Drizzle/SQLite on the server; React/Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query on the client).

GOAL:
Fix and complete the CLIENT-SIDE payments/spending experience so clients can clearly access a “Money” area, view reimbursements/service charges, approve, pay externally via Venmo or Zelle, and confirm payment—all with a premium “white glove” UX. Also ensure navigation is mobile-safe with proper safe-area padding and horizontal scrolling if tabs overflow.

CONTEXT (current repo reality):
- There is a Spending page at client/src/pages/spending.tsx routed at /spending, but it isn’t surfaced well for clients.
- There is a Pay Now sheet at client/src/components/pay-now-sheet.tsx that fetches GET /api/pay-options (but this endpoint is missing).
- The server has org payment profile endpoints:
  - GET/PUT /api/org/payment-profile (assistant-only)
- Spending APIs exist:
  - GET/POST /api/spending
  - PATCH /api/spending/:id/status
- Bottom nav exists at client/src/components/layout/bottom-nav.tsx and needs mobile safe-area + overflow handling.

IMPORTANT PRODUCT PRINCIPLES (WHITE GLOVE):
- Client should only see what they need: approve → pay → confirm → receipt.
- Avoid “accounting software” complexity. No editing amounts/vendors by clients.
- Make it feel calm: fewer choices, more guided actions.
- Micro-UX teaches instantly via small premium toasts; no clutter.

========================================================
LEADER-TIER CLIENT “MONEY” EXPERIENCE (MUST IMPLEMENT)
========================================================
The Spending page for CLIENTS should feel like a concierge billing desk, not a spreadsheet.

CLIENT SHOULD SEE (surfaces):
1) “Waiting on you” (most important)
   - Items needing approval
   - Items approved and ready to pay
   - A single primary CTA per item: Approve / Pay / I paid
2) “Recent receipts” (trust + closure)
   - Reconciled items with receipts attached
   - Simple filters: This month / Last month
3) “Monthly summary” (optional, small)
   - “This month: $X reimbursed • Y items”
   - “Export statement” can be hidden for now (assistant-only initially)

CLIENT SHOULD NOT SEE (hide for simplicity & luxury):
- Raw vendor management screens
- Categories/tax breakdowns beyond a simple label
- Editing line items, splitting, reimburse vs invoice nuance
- Complex tables, lots of columns, “accounting language”
- “Delete” actions
- Internals like who created the entry, status enums, audit fields

CLIENT LANGUAGE (copy tone):
- Use “Reimbursement” and “Receipt”, not “spend ledger”.
- Use “Pay now” not “settle balance”.
- Use calm microcopy: “Noted. Thank you — we’ll reconcile and attach your receipt.”

========================================================
DELIVERABLES (IMPLEMENT ALL)
========================================================

1) SERVER: Add a client-safe endpoint: GET /api/pay-options
- File: server/routes.ts (or suitable routes module)
- Auth: require isAuthenticated + householdContext
- Permissions: clients must be able to read pay options (NO assistant-only gates)
- Behavior:
  a) Determine organizationId for req.householdId (load household by householdId)
  b) Load organization payment profile (create defaults if missing)
  c) Return sanitized JSON ONLY:
     {
       venmoUsername: string | null,
       zelleRecipient: string | null,
       defaultPaymentMethod: "VENMO" | "ZELLE",
       payNoteTemplate: string
     }
- IMPORTANT: never return any assistant-only secrets; only these fields.

2) CLIENT NAV: Make “Money/Spending” clearly accessible for CLIENTS + mobile safe
- File: client/src/components/layout/bottom-nav.tsx
- Add a new tab for clients:
  { path: "/spending", icon: Receipt (lucide-react), label: "Money" }  // label “Money” feels premium
- Handle overflow on small screens:
  - Convert tabs container to horizontal scroll:
    overflow-x-auto, scroll-smooth, no-scrollbar
    snap-x snap-mandatory; each tab snap-center
- Add safe-area support:
  - Create a utility class or inline style to add padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)
  - Ensure nav is above home indicator:
    bottom: 0; padding-bottom includes safe-area; keep height consistent
- Update AppLayout padding:
  - File: client/src/components/layout/app-layout.tsx
  - Replace pb-20 with:
    pb-[calc(5.5rem+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]

3) CLIENT SPENDING PAGE: Rebuild IA to “leader-tier”
- File: client/src/pages/spending.tsx
- Detect role (CLIENT vs ASSISTANT) and render different UI.
- For CLIENTS, render these sections in order:

A) Page header
- Title: “Money”
- Subtitle: “Reimbursements and receipts, handled.”
- Optional: small “Payments go to” line (if pay options exist):
  “Paying to: @venmo / zelle@email.com” with copy buttons (recipient + note)
  Keep it subtle.

B) Section 1: “Waiting on you”
- Query spending items filtered to:
  statuses: NEEDS_APPROVAL, APPROVED, PAYMENT_SENT (if client already marked paid but not reconciled)
- Sort order:
  NEEDS_APPROVAL first, then APPROVED, then PAYMENT_SENT
- For each item show only:
  - label (Vendor OR category, whichever is available; keep short)
  - amount
  - date
  - short status label (human):
    NEEDS_APPROVAL → “Approval needed”
    APPROVED → “Ready to pay”
    PAYMENT_SENT → “Marked paid”
- Row actions (one primary action at a time):
  - If NEEDS_APPROVAL: primary “Approve”
  - If APPROVED: primary “Pay now” (opens PayNowSheet)
  - If PAYMENT_SENT: show “Thanks — we’re reconciling.” (no action)
- After client taps Approve:
  - instantly show a toast: “Approved.”
  - automatically open PayNowSheet for that item (premium guided flow)

C) Section 2: “Recent receipts”
- Query reconciled items (RECONCILED) for last 60 days (server filter if available).
- Each row:
  - label, amount, date
  - “Receipt” button if attachment exists
- If you don’t have receipt download yet, show “Receipt attached” with open file action.

D) Section 3: “This month”
- Tiny summary card:
  - total reimbursed (sum of RECONCILED in current month)
  - count
- Keep minimal—no charts for now.

E) States + polish
- Always show skeleton loaders while loading.
- Empty states must feel luxe:
  - Waiting on you empty: “All set. Nothing needs your attention.”
  - Receipts empty: “Receipts will appear here as items are reconciled.”

4) PAY NOW SHEET: Wire to new endpoint + Venmo + Zelle
- File: client/src/components/pay-now-sheet.tsx
- Replace/fix pay options fetch to use GET /api/pay-options response shape above.
- Generate a note using template tokens:
  Support tokens: {ref} {category} {date} {vendor} {amount}
  If missing fields, replace with blank gracefully (no “undefined”).
- Venmo:
  - Provide deep link + web fallback:
    venmo://paycharge?txn=pay&recipients=<username>&amount=<amount>&note=<encoded_note>
    https://venmo.com/<username>?txn=pay&amount=<amount>&note=<encoded_note>
  - Prefer deep link on mobile, fallback to web.
- Zelle:
  - No universal deep link—show:
    Recipient (email/phone) + Copy
    Amount + Copy
    Note + Copy
    Instruction line: “Pay in your bank’s Zelle, then tap ‘I paid’.”
- “I paid”:
  - Call PATCH /api/spending/:id/status with { status: "PAYMENT_SENT", paymentMethodUsed: "VENMO"|"ZELLE", paymentNote }
    (If server doesn’t accept extra fields yet, add them or ignore safely.)
  - Optimistic update.
  - Toast: “Marked as paid. Thank you.”
- Micro-UX toasts:
  - Copy recipient/note/amount → “Copied.”
  - Opening Venmo → “Opening Venmo…”
  - Payment not configured → “Payment method not set up yet.”

First-time helper (teach instantly, then disappear):
- On first open only (localStorage flag):
  Show a small helper line:
  “Venmo opens pre-filled. Zelle copies details.”

Scroll + safe areas (required):
- PayNowSheet must be a mobile Drawer with:
  - max-height: calc(100vh - env(safe-area-inset-top) - 16px)
  - internal scroll region overflow-y-auto
  - sticky bottom action bar with padding-bottom env(safe-area-inset-bottom)

5) OPTIONAL BUT IMPORTANT: Add a “Money” entry point inside Approvals for clients
- File: client/src/pages/approvals.tsx
- If role is CLIENT:
  - Add a compact card at top:
    “Payments waiting” + badge count + button → /spending
  - Keep it subtle, premium.

6) QA CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
- Client can reach /spending from bottom nav (“Money” tab).
- /api/pay-options works for clients (no permission errors).
- Client spending page shows “Waiting on you” with guided actions.
- Approving an item triggers toast and opens PayNowSheet.
- Venmo button opens with amount/note prefilled (deep link + web fallback).
- Zelle flow supports copy buttons + toasts.
- “I paid” updates status to PAYMENT_SENT and reflects in UI.
- Content never hides behind bottom nav on iOS (safe-area padding).
- Nav remains usable on small screens (horizontal scroll/snap works).

Implement with minimal disruption to existing code style, reuse UI primitives/toast utilities, and keep assistant flows intact.

At the end, list files changed and briefly describe each change.
